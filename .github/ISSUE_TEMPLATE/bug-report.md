#### 🐞 Bug Details
- **Reproduction Steps**:  
  1. <Step 1, e.g., "Pair device via mobile app.">  
  2. <Step 2, e.g., "Turn off Samsung Frame overnight.">  
  3. <Repro rate, e.g., "Happens 80% of time on v1.2.0.">  

- **Expected Behavior**:  
  <What should happen, e.g., "Screen remains vertical on wake-up.">

- **Actual Behavior**:  
  <What happens instead, e.g., "Rotates to horizontal; requires app intervention.">

#### 📌 Core Requirements (Triage Checklist)
- [ ] Reproducible locally? (Run on lab device per KMS Runbook.)  
- [ ] Tied to SLO? (e.g., p90 reconnect <2s from OSS Guidance.)  
- [ ] Scope Estimate: <e.g., "2d spike for debug + fix.">  
- [ ] Related Issues/PRs: <Link to cross-repo issues, e.g., #123 in ffos.>  
- [ ] Tests Needed: <e.g., Add to Firmware System Tests (OTA, Factory Reset).>
